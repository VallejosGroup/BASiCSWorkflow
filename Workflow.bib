abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases, artifacts and other sources of unwanted variation are present in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalization. Results: We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a conveni-ent, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flex-ible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development. Availability and Implementation: The open-source code, along with installation instructions, vi-gnettes and case studies, is available through Bioconductor at},

@article{Robinson2009,
abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which are differentially expressed between two experimental conditions. RESULTS We present a discrete, distributional method for differential gene expression (D(3)E), a novel algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. We use synthetic data to evaluate D(3)E, demonstrating that it can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. Since D(3)E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D(3)E to investigate experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression. CONCLUSION Evaluation using synthetic data shows that D(3)E performs better than other methods for identifying differentially expressed genes since it is designed to take full advantage of the information available from single-cell RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, the analytical model underlying D(3)E makes it possible to gain additional biological insights.},

abstract = {Differentiation of na{\"{i}}ve CD4(+) T cells into functionally distinct T helper subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Due to extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis using a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous TCR sequences, we first demonstrated that Th1/Tfh bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with Th1 or Tfh fates, and demonstrated a T-cell intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting a Th1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between Th1 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in this infection. Th1 and Tfh fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that upregulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell in driving Th1/Tfh fates. In particular, we found that precursor Th cells were coached towards a Th1 but not a Tfh fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources, a database www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling Th1/Tfh fate commitment, and more generally, GPfates, a modelling framework for characterizing cell differentiation towards multiple fates.},

abstract = {Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize variation in gene expression levels at high resolution. However, the sources of experimental noise in scRNA-seq are not yet well understood. We investigated the technical variation associated with sample processing using the single cell Fluidigm C1 platform. To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels. Based on our results, we suggest a framework for effective scRNA-seq studies.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterise this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinders meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce a novel analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. Moreover, we introduce a new and robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronisation of the translational machinery in immune cells upon activation. Additionally, our approach identifies new patterns of variability across CD4+ T cell differentiation.},

abstract = {The major and essential objective of pre-implantation development is to establish embryonic and extra-embryonic cell fates. To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation.},

abstract = {The advent of single cell transcriptome analysis has permitted the discovery of cell-to-cell variation in transcriptome expression of even presumptively identical cells. We hypothesize that this variability reflects a many-to-one relation between transcriptome states and the phenotype of a cell. In this relation, the molecular ratios of the subsets of RNA are determined by the stoichiometric constraints of the cell systems, which underdetermine the transcriptome state. Furthermore, the variability is, in part, induced by the tissue context and is important for system-level function. This theory is analogous to theories of literary deconstruction, where multiple 'signifiers' work in opposition to one another to create meaning. By analogy, transcriptome phenotypes should be defined as subsets of RNAs comprising selected RNA systems where the system-associated RNAs are balanced with each other to produce the associated cellular function. This idea provides a framework for understanding cellular heterogeneity in phenotypic responses to variant conditions, such as disease challenge. Comparisons of transcriptomes between seemingly identical cells show that the transcriptomes have significant biological variation.Cells exhibit 'many-to-one' sets of equally functional transcriptional states that are defined, in part, by pathway constraints that are underspecified in comparison to the number of genes.Cellular contextualization occurs from the influence of the microenvironment and local interactions, suggesting that variation itself is important for system-level function.},

Not surprisingly, these findings have elicited substantial interest in deeply characterizing the diversity, interrelationships and plasticity among cellular phenotypes. To explore these questions, experimental platforms are needed that can extensively and controllably profile many individual cells. Here, microfluidic structures - whether valve-, droplet- or nanowell-based - have an important role because they can facilitate easy capture and processing of single cells and their components, reducing labour and costs relative to conventional plate-based methods while also improving consistency. In this article, we review the current state-of-the-art methodologies with respect to microfluidics for mammalian single-cell 'omics' and discuss challenges and future opportunities.},

This heterogeneity has come into sharp focus in recent years through developments in new imaging and sequencing technologies.

Much of the variability may arise from random effects occurring in the processes of gene expression (transcription, RNA processing and decay, translation). The molecular basis of these effects is largely unknown. Likewise, a functional role of this variability in growth, differentiation and disease has only been elucidated in a few cases.

Single-cell RNA sequencing circumvents these problems, but has so far been limited to specific organ systems 2 . Here, we report single-cell transcriptomic characterization of {\textgreater}20,000 cells immediately following gastrulation at E8.25 of mouse development. We identify 20 major cell types, which frequently contain substructure, including three distinct signatures in early foregut cells. Pseudo-space ordering of somitic progenitor cells identifies dynamic waves of transcription and candidate regulators, which are validated by molecular characterization of spatially resolved regions of the embryo. Within the endothelial population, cells that transition from haemogenic endothelial to erythro-myeloid progenitors specifically express Alox5 and its co-factor Alox5ap, which control leukotriene production. Functional assays using mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrate that leukotrienes promote haematopoietic progenitor cell generation. Thus, this comprehensive single-cell map can be exploited to reveal previously unrecognized pathways that contribute to tissue development.},

Clustering analysis of the transcriptomes of 66 cells demonstrated that initially they are non-distinguishable. Early in the segregation, lineage-specific marker expression exhibited no apparent correlation, and a hierarchical relationship was established only in the late blastocyst. Fgf4 exhibited a bimodal expression at the earliest stage analysed, and in its absence, the differentiation of PrE and EPI was halted, indicating that Fgf4 drives, and is required for, ICM lineage segregation.

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

abstract = {The large variability in mRNA and protein levels found from both static and dynamic measurements in single cells has been largely attributed to random periods of transcription, often occurring in bursts. The cell cycle has a pronounced global role in affecting transcriptional and translational output, but how this influences transcriptional statistics from noisy promoters is unknown and generally ignored by current stochastic models. Here we show that variable transcription from the synthetic tetO promoter in S. cerevisiae is dominated by its dependence on the cell cycle. Real-time measurements of fluorescent protein at high expression levels indicate tetO promoters increase transcription rate ∼2-fold in S/G2/M similar to constitutive genes. At low expression levels, where tetO promoters are thought to generate infrequent bursts of transcription, we observe random pulses of expression restricted to S/G2/M, which are correlated between homologous promoters present in the same cell. The analysis of static, single-cell mRNA measurements at different points along the cell cycle corroborates these findings. Our results demonstrate that highly variable mRNA distributions in yeast are not solely the result of randomly switching between periods of active and inactive gene expression, but instead largely driven by differences in transcriptional activity between G1 and S/G2/M.},

abstract = {Cellular heterogeneity, which plays an essential role in biological phenomena, such as drug resistance and migration, is considered to arise from intrinsic (i.e., reaction kinetics) and extrinsic (i.e., protein variability) noise in the cell. However, the mechanistic effects of these types of noise to determine the heterogeneity of signal responses have not been elucidated. Here, we report that the output of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling activity is modulated by cellular noise, particularly by extrinsic noise of particular signaling components in the pathway. We developed a mathematical model of the EGF signaling pathway incorporating regulation between extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is necessary for switch-like activation of the nuclear ERK response. As the threshold of switch-like behavior is more sensitive to perturbations than the graded response, the effect of biological noise is potentially critical for cell fate decision. Our simulation analysis indicated that extrinsic noise, but not intrinsic noise, contributes to cell-to-cell heterogeneity of nuclear ERK. In addition, we accurately estimated variations in abundance of the signal proteins between individual cells by direct comparison of experimental data with simulation results using Apparent Measurement Error (AME). AME was constant regardless of whether the protein levels varied in a correlated manner, while covariation among proteins influenced cell-to-cell heterogeneity of nuclear ERK, suppressing the variation. Simulations using the estimated protein abundances showed that each protein species has different effects on cell-to-cell variation in the nuclear ERK response. In particular, variability of EGF receptor, Ras, Raf, and MEK strongly influenced cellular heterogeneity, while others did not. Overall, our results indicated that cellular heterogeneity in response to EGF is strongly driven by extrinsic noise, and that such heterogeneity results from variability of particular protein species that function as sensitive nodes, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases.},

abstract = {Elucidating the role of molecular stochasticity in cellular growth is central to understanding phenotypic heterogeneity and the stability of cellular proliferation. The inherent stochasticity of metabolic reaction events should have negligible effect, because of averaging over the many reaction events contributing to growth. Indeed, metabolism and growth are often considered to be constant for fixed conditions. Stochastic fluctuations in the expression level of metabolic enzymes could produce variations in the reactions they catalyse. However, whether such molecular fluctuations can affect growth is unclear, given the various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms, the slow adjustment of key cellular components such as ribosomes, and the secretion and buffering of excess metabolites. Here we use time-lapse microscopy to measure fluctuations in the instantaneous growth rate of single cells of Escherichia coli, and quantify time-resolved cross-correlations with the expression of lac genes and enzymes in central metabolism. We show that expression fluctuations of catabolically active enzymes can propagate and cause growth fluctuations, with transmission depending on the limitation of the enzyme to growth. Conversely, growth fluctuations propagate back to perturb expression. Accordingly, enzymes were found to transmit noise to other unrelated genes via growth. Homeostasis is promoted by a noise-cancelling mechanism that exploits fluctuations in the dilution of proteins by cell-volume expansion. The results indicate that molecular noise is propagated not only by regulatory proteins but also by metabolic reactions. They also suggest that cellular metabolism is inherently stochastic, and a generic source of phenotypic heterogeneity.},

@article{Faure2017,
abstract = {Isogenic cells in a common environment show substantial cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, often referred to as “expression noise.” Here, we use multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to identify features associated with high or low expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells. These include the core promoter architecture of a gene, with CpG island promoters and a TATA box associated with low and high noise, respectively. High noise is also associated with “conflicting” chromatin states—the absence of transcription-associated histone modifications or the presence of repressive ones in active genes. Genes regulated by pluripotency factors through super-enhancers show high and correlated expression variability, consistent with fluctuations in the pluripotent state. Together, our results provide an integrated view of how core promoters, chromatin, regulation, and pluripotency fluctuations contribute to the variability of gene expression across individual stem cells. An integrative computational analysis identifies regulatory features that are statistically associated with high and low gene expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells.},

abstract = {Population phenotypic variation can arise from genetic differences between individuals, or from cellular heterogeneity in an isogenic group of cells or organisms. The emergence of gene expression differences between genetically identical cells is referred to as gene expression noise, the sources of which are not well understood. In this work, by studying gene expression noise between multiple cell lineages and mammalian species, we find consistent evidence of a role for CpG islands as sources of gene expression noise. Variation in noise among CpG island promoters can be partially attributed to differences in island size, in which short islands have noisier gene expression. Building on these findings, we investigate the potential for short CpG islands to act as fast response elements to environmental stimuli. Specifically, we find that these islands are enriched amongst primary response genes in SWI/SNF-independent stimuli, suggesting that expression noise is an indicator of promoter responsiveness. Thus, through the integration of single-cell RNA expression profiling, chromatin landscape and temporal gene expression dynamics, we have uncovered a role for short CpG island promoters as fast response elements.},

Antigen-specific T cells exerted dynamic translational control of gene expression that correlated with cell proliferation and stimulation via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). The translation of mRNAs that encode translation machinery, including ribosomal proteins, was upregulated during the T cell clonal-expansion phase, followed by inhibition of the translation of those transcripts when the CD8(+) Teff cells stopped dividing just before the contraction phase. That translational suppression was more pronounced in terminal effector cells than in memory precursor cells and was regulated by antigenic stimulation and signals from the kinase mTOR. Our studies show that translation of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins is regulated during the differentiation of CD8(+) Teff cells and might have a role in fate 'decisions' involved in the formation of memory cells.},

Lack of full concordance of these datasets has illustrated that important facets of T-cell activation are controlled at the level of translation. We undertook translatome analysis of CD8 T-cell activation, combining polysome profiling and microarray analysis. We revealed that altering T-cell receptor stimulation influenced recruitment of mRNAs to heavy polysomes and translation of subsets of genes. A major pathway that was compromised, when TCR signaling was suboptimal, was linked to ribosome biogenesis, a rate-limiting factor in both cell growth and proliferation. Defective TCR signaling affected transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA precursors, as well as the translation of specific ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Mechanistically, IL-2 production was compromised in weakly stimulated T cells, affecting the abundance of Myc protein, a known regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Consequently, weakly activated T cells showed impaired production of ribosomes and a failure to maintain proliferative capacity after stimulation. We demonstrate that primary T cells respond to various environmental cues by regulating ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation at multiple levels to sustain proliferation and differentiation.},

abstract = {Thymus development is critical to the adaptive immune system, yet a comprehensive transcriptional framework capturing thymus organogenesis at single-cell resolution is still needed. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to capture 8 days of thymus development, perturbations of T cell receptor rearrangement, and in vitro organ cultures, producing profiles of 24,279 cells. We resolved transcriptional heterogeneity of developing lymphocytes, and genetic perturbation confirmed T cell identity of conventional and non-conventional lymphocytes. We characterized maturation dynamics of thymic epithelial cells in vivo, classified cell maturation state in a thymic organ culture, and revealed the intrinsic capacity of thymic epithelium to preserve transcriptional regularity despite exposure to exogenous retinoic acid. Finally, by integrating the cell atlas with human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and autoimmune-disease-related genes, we implicated embryonic thymus-resident cells as possible participants in autoimmune disease etiologies. This resource provides a single-cell transcriptional framework for biological discovery and molecular analysis of thymus organogenesis. Studies of thymus development typically lack single-cell resolution, use indirect readouts, or target narrow cell subsets. Using single-cell RNA sequencing during thymus organogenesis, Kernfeld and Genga et al. reveal cellular heterogeneity, interrogate developmental dynamics by direct observation, and pinpoint cell-specific expression patterns in stromal and blood populations.},

Our ability to quantify cell-t o-cell variability in numerous biological contexts has been revolutionized by recent advances in single-c ell technology, from imaging approaches through to `omics' strategies. However, defining, accurately measuring and disentangling the stochastic and deterministic components of cell-to-cell variability is challenging.

Networks of cytokines and transcription factors are critical for determining CD4+ T-cell fates and effector cytokine production. Here, we review collaboration and cross-regulation between various essential cytokines in the activation {$\fracslash$} induction of key transcription factors during the process of Th cell differentiation towards these distinct lineages.

  abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling has revealed remarkable variation in transcription, suggesting that expression of many genes at the single-cell level is intrinsically stochastic and noisy. Yet, on the cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how can their expression stability be assessed? We have previously proposed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells for scRNA-seq data normalization and integration. In this study, we perform detailed evaluation and characterization of SEGs derived from this framework. Results: Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets and the ''Mouse Atlas'' dataset are reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells. Conclusions: SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation and stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications such as scRNA-seq data normalization. Our framework for calculating gene stability index, ''scSEGIndex,'' is incorporated into the scMerge Bioconductor R package (https://sydneybiox.github.io/scMerge/reference/scSEGIndex.html) and can be used for identifying genes with stable expression in scRNA-seq datasets.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression heterogeneity but suffers from stochastic dropout and characteristic bimodal expression distributions in which expression is either strongly non-zero or non-detectable. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model for such bimodal data that parameterizes both of these features. We argue that the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes expressed in a cell, should be adjusted for as a source of nuisance variation. Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment.

  abstract = {One of the earliest cell surface antigens expressed by T cells following activation is CD69, which is detectable within one h of ligation of the T cell receptorKD3 complex. Once expressed, CD69 acts as a costimulatory molecule for T cell activation and proliferation. In addition to mature T cells, CD69 is inducibly expressed by immature thymocytes, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, and is constitutively expressed by mature thymocytes and platelets. Recently, cDNA clones encoding human and mouse CD69 were isolated and showed CD69 to be a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. Gene mapping studies have placed CD69 on distal mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 1 2 \textasciitilde{} 1 3c,lose to, if not in, the NK gene complex. The structure, chromosomal localization, expression and function of CD69 suggest that it is likely a pleiotropic immune regulator, potentially important not only in NK cell function but also in the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of hematopoietic cells.},

  abstract = {Mixture modeling provides an effective approach to the differential expression problem in microarray data analysis. Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike-in data, and in a cross-validation calculation.},
